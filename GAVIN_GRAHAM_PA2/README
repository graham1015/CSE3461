To run the program:
    python ./Apriori.py -database_file database.txt -minsupp alpha -output_file output.txt

In the functions I used the following data structures


generate_F1:
    database:2d array
    F1: Dictionary

generate_candidate:
    Fk:Dictionary
    lk: Set
    Lk: Set of sets

prune_candidate:
    Fk:Dictionary
    fk: Set
    lk: Set
    Lk: Set of sets
    toPrune: Set

count_support:
    Lk: Set of sets
    database: 2d array
